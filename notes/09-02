# Graspy: package for doing statistical analysis on networks.
Many people at hopkins working on statistical approaches for analyzing networks.

- Graph embedding
    Take a network, convert it into a set of points.
    Each node in the graph is represented as a point in some space.
- Statistical network model fitting/sampling
    Think of e.g. multivariate normal as model for data. We have models specifically for networks.
- Clustering
- Graph matching
    Find correspondence between nodes in networks across multiple graphs
- Graph 2-sample testing
    Two groups, how do we find out if these groups are meaningfully different under some model?
    essentially hypothesis testing.


# Graspologic
- topologic
    Another package, developed by microsoft research. Graspy/topologic will merge "graspologic"
    soon, our code will start to get merged into their code. Later, these engineers will be reviewing our code.
